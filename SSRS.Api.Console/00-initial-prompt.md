I'll help you write an API call for the SRSS REST v2 API using C#. Let me first search for current information about this specific API to ensure I provide accurate guidance.Based on the search results, I can see you're asking about the **SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) REST v2 API**. Here's how to write API calls from first principles using C#:

## Understanding SSRS REST v2 API Basics

Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Reporting Services supports Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs. REST APIs are service endpoints that support a set of HTTP operations (methods). These methods provide create, retrieve, update, or delete access for resources within a report server.

The API follows this URL pattern:
```
http://your-server/Reports/api/v2.0/{resource}
```

## Basic C# Implementation

Here's a fundamental approach to making SSRS REST API calls:## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. **Authentication Methods**
The SSRS RestAPI is documented on Swaggerhub and provides an explicit SESSION path which will complete Authentication with body content passed with a HTTP Post. The most common approaches are:

- **Windows Authentication (NTLM)**: Use `UseDefaultCredentials = true`
- **Custom Security**: Use the `/Session` endpoint
- **Basic Authentication**: Pass credentials via `NetworkCredential`

### 2. **Base URL Structure**
The command uses the report server URL and then references the API, version 2.0:
```
http://localhost/Reports_SSRS/api/v2.0/Reports
```

### 3. **Available Endpoints**
Common SSRS REST API v2 endpoints include:
- `/Reports` - Manage reports
- `/Folders` - Manage folders  
- `/DataSources` - Manage data sources
- `/DataSets` - Manage datasets
- `/CatalogItems` - Access all catalog items
- `/Session` - Handle authentication

### 4. **OData Query Parameters**
Next, we can add arguments to our request to limit or filter the returned values:
- `$top=n` - Limit number of results
- `$filter=expression` - Filter results
- `$select=fields` - Select specific fields

Example: `http://server/Reports/api/v2.0/Reports?$filter=contains(Description,'map')`

### 5. **Error Handling**
Always check HTTP status codes and handle common scenarios:
- **200**: Success
- **400**: Bad Request  
- **401**: Unauthorized
- **404**: Not Found
- **500**: Server Error

## Simple Usage Examples

For basic operations, you can also use simpler approaches:

```csharp
// Quick GET request
using var client = new HttpClient(new HttpClientHandler { UseDefaultCredentials = true });
var response = await client.GetStringAsync("http://server/Reports/api/v2.0/Reports");

// With authentication headers for custom security
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
    new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "your-token");
```

The REST API provides programmatic access to the objects in a SQL Server 2017 Reporting Services report server catalog, making it perfect for automating report management, deployment, and monitoring tasks.
