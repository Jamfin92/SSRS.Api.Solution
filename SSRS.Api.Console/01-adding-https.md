There are several important differences when using HTTPS URLs with the SSRS REST API. Here are the key considerations and code modifications you'll need:

## Key Differences When Using HTTPS

### 1. **SSL Certificate Validation**
The biggest difference with HTTPS is certificate validation. You'll encounter issues if:

- **Self-signed certificates**: Common in development/internal environments
- **Internal Certificate Authority**: Certificates issued by your organization's CA
- **Certificate name mismatch**: Certificate subject doesn't match the server URL
- **Expired certificates**: Past their validity period

### 2. **Port Configuration**
- **HTTP**: Usually port 80 (default) or custom port like 8080
- **HTTPS**: Usually port 443 (default) or custom port like 8443

Examples:
```csharp
// HTTP (typically port 80)
var client = new SSRSRestClient("http://server/ReportServer");

// HTTPS (typically port 443) 
var client = new SSRSRestClient("https://server/ReportServer");

// HTTPS with custom port
var client = new SSRSRestClient("https://server:8443/ReportServer");
```

### 3. **Authentication Considerations**
HTTPS can affect authentication in several ways:

- **Windows Authentication over HTTPS**: Generally works better and is more secure
- **Custom security extensions**: May require different session handling
- **Token-based authentication**: Tokens are protected during transmission

### 4. **Configuration Requirements**

#### For Development/Testing:
```csharp
// Ignore SSL errors (NOT for production!)
var client = new SSRSRestClient("https://localhost:8443", 
    ignoreSslErrors: true);
```

#### For Production:
```csharp
// Proper certificate validation
var client = new SSRSRestClient("https://reports.company.com");

// Test connection first
var testResult = await client.TestConnectionAsync();
if (!testResult.IsSuccessful)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Connection failed: {testResult.ErrorMessage}");
}
```

### 5. **Common HTTPS Issues and Solutions**

#### Issue: "The SSL connection could not be established"
**Solutions:**
1. Install the certificate in Windows Certificate Store
2. Use `ignoreSslErrors = true` for development only
3. Verify the certificate subject name matches your URL

#### Issue: "The remote certificate is invalid"
**Solutions:**
```csharp
// Add trusted certificate thumbprints
private static readonly string[] TrustedThumbprints = {
    "ABC123...", // Your certificate thumbprint
    "DEF456..."  // Another trusted certificate
};
```

#### Issue: Performance is slower than HTTP
**Solutions:**
- Increase timeout values
- Use connection pooling
- Consider HTTP/2 if available

### 6. **Security Best Practices for HTTPS**

```csharp
public class SecureSSRSClient : SSRSRestClient
{
    public SecureSSRSClient(string serverUrl, string username, string password) 
        : base(serverUrl, null, username, password, false) // Never ignore SSL errors in production
    {
        // Additional security configurations
    }
    
    protected override bool ValidateServerCertificate(HttpRequestMessage request, 
        X509Certificate2 certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslErrors)
    {
        // Implement strict certificate validation
        if (sslErrors != SslPolicyErrors.None)
        {
            LogSecurityEvent($"SSL validation failed: {sslErrors}");
            return false;
        }
        
        // Additional checks (certificate pinning, etc.)
        return base.ValidateServerCertificate(request, certificate, chain, sslErrors);
    }
}
```

### 7. **Environment-Specific URL Patterns**

```csharp
public static class SSRSConfiguration
{
    public static string GetSSRSUrl(string environment)
    {
        return environment.ToLower() switch
        {
            "development" => "https://dev-reports.company.com:8443",
            "staging" => "https://staging-reports.company.com",
            "production" => "https://reports.company.com",
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Unknown environment")
        };
    }
}

// Usage
var url = SSRSConfiguration.GetSSRSUrl("production");
var client = new SSRSRestClient(url, "domain", "username", "password");
```

### 8. **Troubleshooting HTTPS Connections**

Add this helper method to diagnose HTTPS issues:

```csharp
public static async Task DiagnoseHttpsConnection(string httpsUrl)
{
    try
    {
        var request = WebRequest.Create(httpsUrl);
        var response = await request.GetResponseAsync();
        Console.WriteLine("✅ HTTPS connection successful");
    }
    catch (WebException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"❌ HTTPS connection failed: {ex.Message}");
        
        if (ex.Message.Contains("SSL"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Troubleshooting steps:");
            Console.WriteLine("1. Check certificate validity");
            Console.WriteLine("2. Verify certificate subject name");
            Console.WriteLine("3. Install certificate in trusted store");
            Console.WriteLine("4. Check firewall/proxy settings");
        }
    }
}
```

The main takeaway is that HTTPS adds a layer of complexity around certificate validation, but it's essential for production environments to ensure secure communication with your SSRS server.
